# CS-171 Checkers Project
This was a project to create an AI to play the game Checkers, by incorporating the minmax algorithm 
along with custom heuristics. 

To run the game, navigate to /src/checkers-python/ in a terminal and call the command
"python3 main.py 7 7 2 l ../../Tools/Sample_AIs/Average_AI/AverageAI.pyc StudentAI.py"

* Python Version 3.5.2 needs to be used
