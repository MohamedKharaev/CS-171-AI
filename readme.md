# CS-171 Checkers Project
This was a project to create an AI to play the game Checkers, by incorporating the minmax algorithm 
along with custom heuristics. 

To run the game, navigate to /Tools in a terminal and call the command
"python3 AI_Runner.py 6 6 2 l ../src/checkers-python/main.py Sample_AIs/Average_AI/main.py"

* Python Version 3.5.2 needs to be used
